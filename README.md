for a wide variety of languages, using the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR) as a representative text. The UDHR was selected because it is
available in a large number of languages, in particular from the [Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)][ohchr].

## Available Languages
