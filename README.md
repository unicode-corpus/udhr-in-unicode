# UDHR in Unicode

Project homepage: http://unicode.org/udhr/

Git mirror: https://github.com/unicode-corpus/udhr-in-unicode

## Goal

The goal of the UDHR in Unicode project is to demonstrate the use of Unicode for
a wide variety of languages, using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR) as a representative text. The UDHR was selected because it is available
in a large number of languages, in particular from the [Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR)](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/).

## Available Languages

See the [Translations](http://unicode.org/udhr/translations.html) page for the
list of langauges available and their support level.
